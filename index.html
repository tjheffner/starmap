    <p>John Cage wrote a few sonatas from the placement of stars in the sky.
    He used sections of starcharts to transpose the locations of certain stars to their equivalent on
    a music staff. My idea for this project is similar--- taking a random image of stars to play a note
    corresponding to the individual locations of stars on screen.</p>
